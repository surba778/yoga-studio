            <h2>Feel Healthy</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Yoga is an Indian, multi-thousand-year-old philosophy of life and health science that strives for the individual to find peace and inner satisfaction regardless of life's shifts.
In the West, we often measure our value in how much we perform. That endeavor may seem good but creates a stress inside that in the long run causes health problems. 
Stress is not only a mental condition but also greatly affects the physical body with, among other things, tension pain, weakened immune system and poor nutrition. 
Eventually, the body no longer has enough energy to expend on cleansing and building up, making it more and more susceptible to disease and injury.
Yoga counteracts this corrosive process. Performing intelligently designed movements in step with a deep, conscious breathing is calming, enables recovery and provides effective physical exercise.
During the yoga course, you will learn different techniques for relaxation, focus and body control. All to create a life where a strong and healthy body harbors a satisfying and loving state of mind. Just as it was originally intended.

            <h2>Good for your heart</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Yoga has long been known to lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate. A slower heart rate can benefit people with high blood pressure or heart disease, and people who've had a stroke.
Yoga has also been linked to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and better immune system function.

            <hr>
            <p>
                You may feel less stressed and more relaxed after doing some yoga. Some yoga styles use meditation techniques that help calm the mind. Focusing on your breathing during yoga can do that, too.

            <h2>Breathing benefits</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Yoga usually involves paying attention to your breath, which can help you relax. It may also call for specific breathing techniques. 
                But yoga typically isn't aerobic, like running or cycling, unless it's an intense type of yoga.
